        <h2>Fashion Across the World</h2>
        <p>Fashion in Europe and fashion in the United States, although at times similar, differs greatly. As someone who spends 9 months out of the year in the US and the remaining 3 months in Europe, I have noticed a lot of these differences. For example, it comes as a shock to many Americans that it is almost socially unacceptable to wear sweatpants out in public in Europe. I know I wear sweatpants to class all the time, so I always have to re-adjust when I come back home for the summer. Another thing that is really different is the type of shoes people wear. In the US, I will see people leaving the house in moccasins, which would be considered house slippers in Europe. While Europeans definitely value comfort while walking, they would never skimp on style for the sake of comfort. I know these observations may seem relatively irrelevant, but when you really look at it, the small differences become very noticeable. Europeans like to say they can spot an American a mile away, and as much as it may come across as an insult, it is very much true. Just some food for thought! <br/>Katarina Musicki - 05/02/2024</p>

        <h2>Quality Makes a Difference</h2>
        <p>My last post was about fashion, but this one is about food. I noticed that the food in Europe tastes a lot better than the food in the United States. I guess the way I would describe it is that the food tastes more fresh and flavorful, but it doesn't necessarily look as vibrant. I wonder if this is because of the preservatives that are or are not in the food. On a separate but not entirely unrelated note, I noticed that there are a lot less people in Europe who appear to struggle with obesity. I think this could be connected to the quality of the food, but it could also be connected to the fast food habits of Americans versus Europeans. Europeans also tend to live more active lifestyles with respect to living in cities, where they walk almost everywhere. I did a little bit of research about this and found that in the US 39% of adults suffer from obesity, and 36% consume fast food on a daily basis. To contrast this, I looked into these rates for the French and the Serbians. Their obesity rates were 17% and 23%, respectively, and their percentage of those who eat out regularly were only 16% and 18%. To me, these numbers look like they could be directly related to each other. <br/>Katarina Musicki - 05/04/2024</p>
