        <p>Hi! My name is Katarina Musicki. I am 20 years old and am from Novi Sad, Serbia. I go to Michigan State University and I am studying Information Science. I live in the United States during the school year, but I live in Serbia over the summer. <br/>I love to write. I have a passion for sharing things with others through my writing. I was not always very good at it, but after years of studying and hard work, I am proud to say that my writing skills have become much better. I often have people tell me that they have no idea that English was not my first language, even though I do sometimes still make mistakes. This is why I like blogging. It is fun, relaxed, and judgement free, for the most part at least. <br/>Something I am passionate about is fashion. I love researching all the newest trends and happenings in the fashion world. Ever since I was little, I was interested in modeling, but not because of how the models look, it was their really cool clothing that drew me to the field. I spend a little bit too much time paying attention to what people are wearing, and also a little bit too much time shopping for new clothes. <br/>Thanks for visiting my blog! I hope you enjoy the content and I hope you come back again soon!</p>
